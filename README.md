# Speed and break way calculating
A small program for calculating the speed and break way of a car. 
This program can be used by police officers, scientists, or traffic officials to determine the maximum speed of cars on a certain section of road.
Used Pyqt5. 
This program was written by me for a scientific conference on mathematics.
